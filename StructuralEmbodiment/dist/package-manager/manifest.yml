description: >
  The Structural Embodiment Toolkit enhances conceptual structural design by streamlining form-finding, materialisation, and visualisation processes, ensuring realistic structure dimensions and site models. It improves interaction with conventional render-based methods like Vray and integrates Stable Diffusion WebUI with access to Multi-ControlNet for advanced visualisation in Grasshopper. This toolkit unifies design workflows, blending traditional techniques with deep learning methods.
